# Deep-Learning
Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning) is part of a broader  family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with  representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.  Deep-learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief  networks, recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks  have been applied to fields including computer vision, machine vision,  speech recognition, natural language processing, audio recognition,  social network filtering, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug  design, medical image analysis, material inspection and board game  programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some  cases surpassing human expert performance. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were inspired by information processing  and distributed communication nodes in biological systems. ANNs have  various differences from biological brains. Specifically, neural networks  tend to be static and symbolic, while the biological brain of most living  organisms is dynamic (plastic) and analogue.
